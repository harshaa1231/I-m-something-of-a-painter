This a repository of the code for the CycleGAN, which transforms photos to monet images

Dataset used taken from the kaggle challenge of: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/overview

Two versions of the model have been updated one a version using Gen_G, other with Gen F

Presently, we have trained the model and were able to make predictions from the saved model as seen in the images.

More details about the project will be explained in a blog. Bound to making changes based on the feedback.
